            <p>The inn is located in the town of Xenos. Xenos can be found on the island of Elysium.
                To get to Elysium take a ferry from either Aerie or Etceter. Once in Xenos, head to the 
                forum in the middle of the town. On there, simply go one block east towards the north.
                The inn backs up to Oden's house (all +5 crafting stations). The Hidden Dragon boasts 
                stellar views of Pleasure Lagoon and the Bay of Storms.
